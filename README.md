## Cawlr
#### Version : alpha-1

I know that there is a lot of great framework/boilerplate out there, and i believe all of the css framework has one aim, to shorten  working time when work on project. If you are happen to be a Front-End developer, than you know the obstacles while using your favorite framework, they might be good but they can't provide all of your need to get a job done and impress client.

As a freelancer, i've been using [Skeleton](getskeleton.com), [Pure CSS](https://purecss.io), [Semantic-ui](semantic-ui.com), [Zurb Foundation](foundation.zurb.com), [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) & [Uikit](getuikit.com). For a couple of year i always find a framework replacement that can meet the needs of my projects.

Then i realise i have to stick with one framework, i choose [Uikit](getuikit.com). I know there is always something missing if i use other people framework, but Uikit is very close to it. I know what is my problem was, i should spend time to wrote a couple of class name in css file, save it and all i have to do is make sure it doesn't collide with [Uikit](getuikit.com) class format name, works if i combine them in one atribute.

I never meant to build complex framework, there is a lot great framework out there, save your time. But if you happen have some related problem like i do, you can wrote your own css extension that can shortfall your favorite framework, or you free to use mine.

So, this is it. My daily css extension for my favorite framework. i call it *Cawlr.

I update the class name when i need the the new features, & if you use *Cawlr* and have some new features that can help both of use, you free to customize it to your own or merged in to *Cawlr*, i'm happy if *Cawlr* help you.
